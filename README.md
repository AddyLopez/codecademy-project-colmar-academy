## Description

- Follows professional wireframes for desktop and mobile display and includes client's media assets
- Accessibility rating by Lighthouse audit: 100/100 for desktop, 97/100 for mobile devices
- Coded in VS Code using professional development workflow tools such as Live Server, GitHub Desktop, and GitHub Pages
- A polished README using Markdown
